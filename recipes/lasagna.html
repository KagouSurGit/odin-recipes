    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground turkey</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 large green pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 small sweet red pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 package (8 ounces) fat-free cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 can (10 ounces) enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>6 whole wheat flour tortillas (8 inches)</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend</li>
            <li>Optional: Salsa and sour cream</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a large skillet, cook turkey, onion and peppers over medium-high heat until turkey is no longer pink, 5-7 minutes, breaking turkey into crumbles. Stir in cream cheese and chili powder.</li>
            <li>Pour enchilada sauce into a shallow bowl. Dip tortillas in sauce to coat. Place 2 tortillas in a 13x9-in. baking dish coated with cooking spray; spread with half the turkey mixture. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Repeat layers. Top with remaining tortillas and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, until heated through and cheese is melted, 20-25 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. If desired, serve with salsa and sour cream.</li>
        </ol>
